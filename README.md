# AI-ChatBot
Created an AI chatbot for answering queries related to Chronic Kidney Disease using NLTK.

# Modules Used:
1. Newspaper:
Newspaper is a Python module used for extracting and parsing newspaper articles. Newspaper use advance algorithms with web scrapping to extract all the useful text from a website. It works amazingly well on online newspapers websites.

2. Count Vectorizer:
The CountVectorizer provides a simple way to both tokenize a collection of text documents and build a vocabulary of known words, but also to encode new documents using that vocabulary. Tokenization of text means- Tokenization is essentially splitting a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or an entire text document into smaller units, such as individual words or terms. Each of these smaller units are called tokens.

3. Punkt Package-
Punkt Sentence Tokenizer. This tokenizer divides a text into a list of sentences, by using an unsupervised algorithm to build a model for abbreviation words, collocations, and words that start sentences. It must be trained on a large collection of plaintext in the target language before it can be used.

Output:


Doc Bot: I am Doctor Bot or Doc Bot for short. I will answer your queries about Chronic Kidney Disease. If you want to exit, type bye.

What is Chronic Kidney disease?

Doc Bot:  Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.
Overview
Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.
