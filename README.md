# AI-ChatBot
Created an AI chatbot for answering queries related to Chronic Kidney Disease using NLTK.

# Modules Used:
1. Newspaper:
Newspaper is a Python module used for extracting and parsing newspaper articles. Newspaper use advance algorithms with web scrapping to extract all the useful text from a website. It works amazingly well on online newspapers websites.

2. Count Vectorizer:
The CountVectorizer provides a simple way to both tokenize a collection of text documents and build a vocabulary of known words, but also to encode new documents using that vocabulary. Tokenization of text means- Tokenization is essentially splitting a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or an entire text document into smaller units, such as individual words or terms. Each of these smaller units are called tokens.

3. Punkt Package-
Punkt Sentence Tokenizer. This tokenizer divides a text into a list of sentences, by using an unsupervised algorithm to build a model for abbreviation words, collocations, and words that start sentences. It must be trained on a large collection of plaintext in the target language before it can be used.

Sample Output:


Doc Bot: I am Doctor Bot or Doc Bot for short. I will answer your queries about Chronic Kidney Disease. If you want to exit, type bye.

Hi

Doc Bot: hola

What is Chronic Kidney disease?

Doc Bot:  Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.
